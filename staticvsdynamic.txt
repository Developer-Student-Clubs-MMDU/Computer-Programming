static memory allocation-->
When the allocation of memory performs at the compile time, then it is known as static memory.
The memory is allocated at the compile time.
In static memory allocation, while executing a program, the memory cannot be changed.
Static memory allocation is preferred in an array.
It saves running time as it is fast.
Static memory allocation allots memory from the stack.
Static memory allocation is less efficient as compared to Dynamic memory allocation.
This memory allocation is simple.

dynamic memory allocation-->
When the memory allocation is done at the execution or run time, then it is called dynamic memory allocation.
The memory is allocated at the runtime.
In dynamic memory allocation, while executing a program, the memory can be changed.
Dynamic memory allocation is preferred in the linked list.
It is slower than static memory allocation.
Dynamic memory allocation allots memory from the heap.
Dynamic memory allocation is more efficient as compared to the Static memory allocation.
This memory allocation is complicated.
