## Brute Force in Competitive Programming

The Brute Force algorithm is simply the intuitive and straightforward method used to solve problems. Its use is not restricted to competitive programming. For example, you want to open your sibling's personal computer and it is protected by a password. So you try guessing the password and inputing every possible password like birth dates for example. This is called Brute Force.

Brute Force in competitive programming can sometimes be handy. However, it consumes time and computing power therefore it is inefficient. The time complexity of Brute Force is according to FreeCodeCamp is O(mn) or O(m*n); if we were to search for a string of "n" characters in a string of "m" characters using brute force, it would take us n * m tries.
